# 8-bit-CPU-logisim
This project implements an 8-bit CPU in Logisim Evolution, featuring a Program Counter, Instruction Register, Control Unit, ALU, and two general-purpose registers. It executes a hardwired instruction set, performing arithmetic and logical operations while demonstrating fetch-decode-execute cycles and flag updates.
